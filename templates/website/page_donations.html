            PyCon Africa is run entirely by volunteers who believe in making technology more accessible across the continent. We're working to connect people, share knowledge, and create opportunities - but we need your help to expand our reach.

        <h2>What we're building</h2>
        <p>
            We're more than just a conference. PyCon Africa exists to open doors, connect people, and plant seeds that grow into careers, projects, and stronger communities. As a completely volunteer-run, non-profit event, all the money we raise goes directly toward making Python more accessible to people who might not otherwise have the chance to get involved.

        <div class="bg-pycon-blue/10 border-l-4 border-pycon-blue p-4 rounded">
            <p class="font-semibold">The more support we receive, the more people we can welcome into our community.</p>

        <h2>Why we need your help</h2>
        <p>
            Running an inclusive, accessible conference costs money. While our sponsors cover the basics, community donations let us expand our impact in meaningful ways.
        </p>
        <p class="font-semibold">Here's what we're working toward:</p>

                    Right now, we can welcome <strong>50 complete beginners</strong> to our <strong>FREE</strong> hands-on workshops. With more support, we'd love to expand this to <strong>150 people</strong>.

    <!-- Why This Matters -->
    <div class="space-y-6">
        <h2>Why this matters</h2>
        <p>
            Technology is growing rapidly across Africa, but learning opportunities aren't equally available everywhere. When you support PyCon Africa, you're helping remove barriers that prevent talented people from getting involved in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
            You're also helping build bridges between developers who might otherwise work in isolation, and creating the kind of catalyst experiences that turn curiosity into careers and careers into community leadership.
        </p>
        <div class="bg-pycon-red/10 border-l-4 border-pycon-red p-4 rounded">
            <p class="font-semibold">The people we support go on to support others in their own communities. The impact multiplies.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- How We Work -->
    <div class="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-8 space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-center">How we work</h2>
        <p class="text-center">
            Since we're completely volunteer-run, your donation goes directly to participants and programming. Our organizers contribute their time because they believe in what we're building, just like you might.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center font-semibold">
            We don't have overhead costs or salaries eating into contributions. When you donate, you're funding opportunities, experiences, and futures.
