# Local development 

## Installation

We are using Python 3.13.12

Install Python dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up the database and cache tables:

```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createcachetable wafer_cache_table
```

```

Generate main css file:

```
npm run tailwind
```

Run the development server

## Tailwind 

We are using TailwindCSS for styling. If you make any changes to `static/css/main.css` or the tailwind classes used in any html file then you will need to rebuild the main tailwind file using `npm run tailwind`.

If you are developing and want to automatically rebuild the css when changes are detected, use `npm run tailwind-w`.

# Deployment 

Make use of `settings_prod.py` when deploying to production. 

To generate and collect static files, do the following:

```
npm install
npm run tailwind
python manage.py collectstatic
```
