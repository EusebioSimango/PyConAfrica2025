PyCon Africa 2024 is returning to Accra, Ghana for a live, in-person event. Over 400 participants will join us in Accra, Ghana, September 24th - 28th, 2024.

Your health and safety are important to us. We want PyCon Africa to be an event that everyone feels safe attending. PyCon Africa will follow applicable state and local health and safety laws, adapting our plans accordingly and sharing updates with you and other PyCon Africa audiences.

The details below are just some of the measures we will implement for PyCon Africa.

We are asking you to wear a mask during your time at PyCon US. That includes talks, the expo hall, hallways and sprints.

Exceptions are:
- Outdoor spaces
- Indoors while actively consuming food or beverages
- Speakers while presenting
- While necessary for communicating with someone who is hearing impaired when the ability to see the mouth is essential for communication
- Very briefly to take photos

Masks must be worn over the nose and mouth and must be made of a tight-knit, non-permeable material. N95 or equivalent masks such as KN95 or K95 are recommended. Alternatives to face coverings such as face shields, loose gaiters, scarves, bandanas, and face coverings with ventilation are not permitted to be used as masks. Although we encourage you to bring your own masks that you find comfortable, there will also be free masks available for attendees during each day of PyCon Africa, as supplies permit. (Want to be our Mask Sponsor? Get in touch!)

Attendees who are repeatedly unwilling to comply with the mask requirements will be asked to leave and are not eligible for a refund. Please don’t be “this person.”

## Vaccinations are encouraged 

We encourage PyCon Africa attendees to stay up to date with the vaccinations that are available to them where they live. We know that PyCon Africa attendees are coming from all over the world and the availability of current vaccines is extremely different from place to place. We encourage you to do your best.

We expect people to stay home if they may be contagious. If you are feeling sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, or test positive for COVID-19, prior to the start of the conference, or on any day of the conference, please contact us at team@pycon.africa, and our health and safety team will advise accordingly.

## Visa Information 
Are you a citizen of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Gambia, Nigeria? Then you do not require a visa to visit Ghana. Citizens of all other countries may require a visa obtainable from any Ghanaian Embassy or Consulate close to them. Do check to know if your country is exempt or may require a visa. You will also be required to have proof of polio, yellow fever, and COVID-19 vaccinations to enter Ghana.

## Airport and travel 

All international travel will be through Kotoka International Airport, Accra, Ghana. Major airlines provide daily services to many international destinations. Some hotels offer pick-up services and we encourage participants with such options to use the services. Taxis are also available in addition to Uber and Bolt services.

## Advice for international visitors
Please read this information carefully, and check every item. Some of it is crucial and it will help you have a better travel process.

Visa: You may need a visa to enter Ghana. You must check this, otherwise, you will most likely be denied entry, or probably not be permitted to board your flight. If you have any questions, please contact us right away.
Vaccination certificate: To enter Ghana, proof of COVID vaccination is not required, but you are strongly recommended to be fully vaccinated, for your protection and for the protection of others, however, a yellow fever vaccination is required. Otherwise, you will likely be denied entry. Please ensure you have this in advance, do not wait until the last minute. Other optional certificates include Hepatitis A, Tetanus, and Typhoid.
Malaria precautions: Malaria precautions are advised. Seek medical advice on whether you should be taking anti-malarial medication.

## Healthy Habits

Hand sanitizing stations will be placed throughout PyCon Africa venues to encourage frequent hand sanitization.
We will issue best practices for attendees that include avoiding shaking hands and how exhibitors can best manage product demonstrations.

## Disclaimer 

PyCon Africa takes these Health & Safety Guidelines very seriously and will therefore enforce a 3-strike rule. Anyone who violates these guidelines on three separate accounts, such as continuing to not wear a proper mask or disregarding social distancing, is subject to removal from the conference. Anyone who provides false vaccination verification will not be admitted to PyCon Africa.
