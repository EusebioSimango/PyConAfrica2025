PyConZA is organised by volunteers, and we rely on more volunteers to help run things during the conference.

We are looking for attendees to help out with the following roles:

- Session Chairs & Microphone wranglers
- Video Team
- Swag packing
- Venue Setup and Teardown
- Discord wrangling (answering questions and pointing people to the right channels for the online event).

If you want to help out, please join the #volunteer-request channel on our discord server and let us know what you're interested in.
