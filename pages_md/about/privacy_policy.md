The Python Software Community in Ghana only collects the information necessary to register you for PyCon and to provide you access to the PyCon content and services. Registrant contact information is NOT shared with third parties without your explicit opt-in consent.

If you submit a talk, tutorial, or other content, then your name will be publicly associated with your personal content for purposes of giving you credit for your contribution to the conference and to maintain historical records.

You may opt in to getting email messages about the PyCon conference, and you may opt-in to sharing basic contact information with sponsors of PyCon. Choosing not to opt in will in no way detract from your ability to attend or engage with PyCon.

## Who Is Responsible For The Personal Information That We Collect?

For the purpose of data protection laws, the Python Software Community in Ghana is the data controller in respect to the personal information that we collect and use as part of our operations. As the data controller, we control, manage, and dictate the purpose for which your personal information is used and how we use your personal information for our operation. Only our system administrators and our support team have access to your data and we are making sure that they comply with relevant data protection requirements in their volunteer work. You can amend and remove any information at any time, from your profile page of the conference website.

If you choose to provide your personal information to other parties during PyCon, including sponsors, then their data privacy policies apply to the data that you give to them.

## What Personal Information Do We Collect?
The type of personal information that we may collect include, but is not limited to the following:

- Full name

If you provide personal information to us regarding or related to a third party, then you confirm that you have the consent of the third party to share such personal information and that you have made the information in this Privacy Policy available to the relevant third party.

We use the information you give us to create and find badges, track helpdesk questions, write invoices, show your profile (if made public), contact you with updates regarding the conference and provide you with access to announcements for subsequent events. For speakers, we may also use the information in the conference booklet, the schedule and on web pages of the conference website. In some cases, we may also use the information to contact you in case we need your help or to address issues we find with the registration data or to resolve helpdesk issues.

Some of the information is also used to create demographics for the conference in anonymous and aggregated form. We use this for advertising the conference to potential sponsors.

## Links to other websites
Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links leaving our site, we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites, which are not governed by this privacy statement.

Information that you have explicitly made available for unrestricted public access, such as having your name associated with a talk that you provide, may not be able to be deleted.
