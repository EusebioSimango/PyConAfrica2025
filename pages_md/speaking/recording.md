Part of the motivation for PyCon Africa is to help with Python education and advocacy in Africa, and the world at large. Accordingly, we intend to record all PyCon presentations and release the recordings on the web.

By submitting your talk, you agree to give permission to the Python Software Community Africa (Python Africa) to record, edit, and release audio and/or video of your presentation. We also perform interviews with poster presenters and require recording releases to publish them.

By default, the recording release checkbox is checked when submitting a proposal. If you wish to opt-out, uncheck the release checkbox. Note that no recordings of your talk will be made. You cannot opt-out of recording for lightning talks.

You agree to the following legalese, which certifies that you are the author of your presentation (or otherwise allowed to present it at PyCon Africa), and which allows the Python Software Community Africa (Python Africa) to: 1. Perform the necessary audio and video editing needed to prepare your presentation. 2. Distribute the recordings to other people, including on YouTube, or video sites. It also allows other people to watch the recordings.
