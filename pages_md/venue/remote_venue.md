The remote portion of our conference will be hosted on Discord. 

**Please note:** If you are a regular PyConZA attendee you might already be registered on the PyConZA Discord server. We are using a different server this year! You will need to join the PyCon Africa server.

Discord joining information will be published in the near future.
