PyCon Africa 2025 is a hybrid conference. This means that we will be having an in-person conference this year, and we will be making sure that those folks who want or need to join us remotely still get a great experience.

## Joining remotely 

All ticket-holders will be able to join the remote event. 

We are supporting remote attendees because many people will be unable to join the event in person, for many reasons.

Remote attendees will have access to:

- Live-streamed and recorded talks 
- Discord community - here they can interact with each other 

## Joining in person 

Note that remote ticket holders will not have access to the in-person event. You need to buy an in-person ticket to access the physical venue.
